                    In August 2017, JYP Entertainment (JYPE) officially announced the agency's new survival reality show.
                    This project aims to launch the male idol that is now known as Stray Kids.Then, do you know Stray Kids members?
                    Stray Kids is a K-pop boy group who debuted under JYP Entertainment on March 25, 2018.
                    Before they debuted, they were part of a competition show also called Stray Kids.
                    They started as a group of 9 members but now they are 8 members due to a member leaving in 2019.
                    Despite this happening, they still stick together as a group.
                    In recent years of K-pop, there have been many groups where members left and it was difficult for some of them to get back up.
                    But not with Stray Kids. This is definitely one of the things that draws our attention to them.
